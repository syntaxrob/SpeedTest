C# Internet download speed test
===============================

A simple console application which tests download speed of an internet connection 100 times before displaying: 
* the average speed
* the max test speed
* the minimum test speed
* the calulated standard deviation (this number wants to be as close to 0 as possible. For more detailed info on this, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation))
