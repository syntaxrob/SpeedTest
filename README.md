C# Internet download speed test
===============================

A simple console application which tests the download speed being used for an internet connection 100 times before displaying: 
* the average speed
* the max test speed
* the minimum test speed
* the calulated standard deviation (this number wants to be as close to 0 as possible. For more detailed info on this, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation))

NICS are now listed out and selectable as well as the number of test cycles can be set (100 test per cycle). Data is written away to a csv file, which will open after all test cycles have run.
